# 👋 Hey, I'm Stefano — Software Engineer & Builder of Cool Things

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I’m a **backend-focused full-stack engineer** with a passion for building fast, scalable systems and making tech feel seamless. Whether it’s clean APIs, real-time apps, game experiments, or AI-powered tools — I like shipping things that work, feel good, and are fun to build.
