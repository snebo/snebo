Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a software developer who loves building things that workâ€”be it a sleek web app, a powerful backend, or a game that keeps you hooked. I keep things simple, efficient, and (hopefully) fun.

## âš¡ A Bit About Me

- I write code, break code, and fix codeâ€”sometimes in that order.  
- I love games, anime, and mechanical keyboards (yes, I have too many).  
- I enjoy clean UI, powerful backends, and software that just *works*.  
- If it's fun, I'll build it. If it's broken, I'll fix it.
